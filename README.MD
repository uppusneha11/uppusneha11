## 🚀 Featured Projects

**FAERS Drug Safety & Pharmacovigilance Analysis**<br>
End-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline built on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to uncover drug–symptom patterns, drug–drug interactions, and dose–response relationships using real-world post-marketing data. <br>
- Processed millions of FAERS adverse event reports across multiple quarterly releases.
- Cleaned and standardized messy real-world data including drug names, dosages, units, and demographics.
- Implemented SQL-based association analysis (support, confidence, lift) to identify symptom co-occurrence patterns.
- Analyzed drug–drug interaction risks using synergy ratios.
- Conducted dose–response analysis using Spearman correlation and logistic regression.
- Built interactive dashboards to explore safety signals and trends.

**Similar Image Finder** <br>
- Engineered a CLIP-powered semantic search engine by extracting ViT-B/32 embeddings from 21,000+ Unsplash images using PyTorch, enabling zero-shot multimodal similarity matching.
- Implemented KNN retrieval with cosine distance in Scikit-Learn, delivering top-6 similar images per query with 0.91 mean accuracy across 1,000 rigorous evaluation tests.
- Created Matplotlib visualization tools for side-by-side result comparisons, similarity score analysis, and embedding space exploration to highlight model interpretability.
- Demonstrated practical applications in content discovery and media management through robust performance on diverse conceptual queries beyond exact visual matches.
