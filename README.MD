##  👋 Hi! I'm Sneha Uppu
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at The George Washington University with a strong focus on **Data Analytics, Data Science,** and **AI-driven solutions**. I love transforming complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent systems that not only solve real-world problems but also create positive social impact. From developing ML models to exploring generative AI and cloud-based solutions, I enjoy pushing boundaries, learning every step of the way, and applying data in ways that drive meaningful change. 

## 🎓 Education

## 💼 Experience

**Data Science Intern**, *Thaddeus Resource Center*(Nov 2025 - Present)<br>
As a Data Science Intern at Thaddeus Resource Center, I work with real-world, multi-source program data to support impact analysis and decision-making. My responsibilities include designing and refining data collection frameworks, cleaning and integrating intake forms, case notes, and engagement records, and performing exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in client engagement and service outcomes. I also develop analytical and machine learning workflows and create dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to translate ambiguous program questions into data-driven solutions.


**Data Support Assistant**, *GWU Libraries* (Jan 2025 – Present) <br>
At GWU Libraries, I analyzed borrowing and circulation data to surface student demand, guiding acquisitions and partner sourcing. I processed nearly 50,000 rows of e-resource usage in Excel (filters, aggregations, lookups) to highlight trends, and structured/validated transaction logs to improve accuracy on overdues, fines, and availability. I also improved dataset organization for researchers and helped design a systematic collection-maintenance approach based on usage histories.

**CRM Data & Analytics Intern**, *PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC - AC)* (Feb 2024 – Aug 2024) <br>
At PwC, I extracted, cleaned, and organized 10,000+ Salesforce CRM records to improve the accuracy of client and sales reporting. I built and optimized interactive dashboards tracking lead conversion, pipeline progression, and customer engagement, giving stakeholders clear, real-time insights. I also coordinated cross-functional work in Jira to streamline workflows and authored 20+ pages of QA documentation (test cases, validation steps) to standardize and strengthen reporting processes.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

**FAERS Drug Safety & Pharmacovigilance Analysis**<br>
End-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline built on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to uncover drug–symptom patterns, drug–drug interactions, and dose–response relationships using real-world post-marketing data. <br>
- Processed millions of FAERS adverse event reports across multiple quarterly releases.
- Cleaned and standardized messy real-world data including drug names, dosages, units, and demographics.
- Implemented SQL-based association analysis (support, confidence, lift) to identify symptom co-occurrence patterns.
- Analyzed drug–drug interaction risks using synergy ratios.
- Conducted dose–response analysis using Spearman correlation and logistic regression.
- Built interactive dashboards to explore safety signals and trends.

**Similar Image Finder** <br>
Team project: we embedded 21k+ Unsplash photos with CLIP ViT-B/32, then used KNN (cosine) to return the top-6 nearest images for any query; evaluated on 1,000 queries with nearly 0.91 average similarity. Implemented in PyTorch and scikit-learn with Matplotlib visualizations. It’s useful for visual search, content discovery, deduplication, and mood-board building.
